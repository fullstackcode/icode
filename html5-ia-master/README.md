# HTML5 in Action
Official repo for Manning Publication's HTML5 in Action. HTML5 in Action provides a complete introduction to web development using HTML5. You'll explore every aspect of the HTML5 specification through real-world examples and code samples. It's much more than just a specification reference, though. It lives up to the name HTML5 in Action by giving you the practical, hands-on guidance you'll need to use key features.

## Live Demo
Examples of all the repo code can be found at http://html5inaction.com. If you notice any issues or something breaks please leave us a message at https://github.com/html5-ia/html5-ia/issues and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. 

## The Book
As a companion for the code examples and how we made them, you'll want a copy of the book. You can get one at http://www.manning.com/crowther2/ in PDF and/or print format.
